Itslearning PHP SDK
===================

SDK to connect with the Organisation API and IMS-ES of itslearning

__Work in progress!__

This SDK is currently under active development, bugs and API changes may apply.

Development
-----------

Setup the environment by cloning this repo (or your fork) and running
`composer install` to fetch development dependencies.

__Running tests__

Copy the `.env.example` and enter your own credentials for a development
school. Do NOT enter production credentials, running tests will create
persons, courses etc., these will not be cleaned up afterwards!

After installation run `phpunit`, this will run the tests and might take a
while.

Patrons
------------

The development of this SDK is made possible by several companies:

 - itslearning
 - e-Loo
 - Label305
